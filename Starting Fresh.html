								<h2>Description</h2>
								<p>Starting Fresh is a simple game where you catch apples. The apples fall from a random x-axis above the screen and fall. If you catch an apple, one point is added to the score counter. If you miss an apple, you lose health. The difficulty scales the longer you play the game by making the apples get faster, but they stop getting faster before it becomes impossible. When you run out of health, the game ends.</p>
								<h2>Developer Notes</h2>
								<p>Starting Fresh was the second Unity game I wanted to release. Before this game, I worked on a very ambitious game while following a Udemy course. I got too overwhelmed halfway through the class and needed to start fresh with a much smaller game. Hence, I made Starting Fresh: a simple game where you catch apples.</p>
								<p>When designing the gameâ€™s point system, I had some fun and gave the score counter some character. Depending on your score, the counter will do one of three animations after making its way to the center of the screen. Scoring 25 points and below will turn the counter bronze and rotate it slightly. Having a score of 26-75 will turn the counter silver. Scoring 76 points or more will turn the counter gold, and the counter will scale up in size when it gets to the middle of the screen.</p>
								<p>I livestreamed the development process on Twitch. Due to Twitch not keeping every livestream, the only remnant of my livestreams is a 24-minute video. <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/avantcode" style="color: blue" target="_blank">twitch.tv/avantcode</a></p>
